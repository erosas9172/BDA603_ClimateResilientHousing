## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project investigates how **climate change**, **gentrification**, and **housing insecurity** intersect for low-income seniors living in **Barrio Logan**, one of San Diego’s most culturally significant yet environmentally vulnerable neighborhoods.

Using a multi-method approach including **GIS spatial analysis**, **demographic enrichment**, **heat exposure modeling**, **stakeholder mapping**, **SWOT analysis**, and a **business model canvas**, the project develops a framework for a **climate-resilient senior housing cooperative**.

The goal is to highlight:
- Where climate risks and displacement pressures overlap  
- Which populations are most affected  
- What design and policy features support resilient, community-led housing  
- How a cooperative model can protect seniors while preserving cultural identity  

---

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Barrio Logan’s **Heat Severity Index = 1.4**, but seniors face heightened vulnerability due to inadequate cooling infrastructure and economic constraints.  
- **382 seniors** live within the planning area, many in older housing stock with limited insulation or tree canopy.  
- **247 households** are severely rent-burdened, amplifying displacement risk.  
- Several **city-owned parcels** present real opportunities for climate-resilient development.  
- Community organizations (Environmental Health Coalition, nonprofits, local artists, residents) show strong support for **cooperative, land-trust, and resilience-focused models**.

## 🧭 Methods & Tools  

### **Spatial & Data Analysis**
- ArcGIS Online  
- Zonal Statistics (heat analysis)  
- Demographic enrichment using ACS + Esri Living Atlas  
- Parcel identification via City of San Diego GIS services  

### **Machine Learning / Forecasting (Optional Extensions)**
- Time-series patterns of climate + demographic vulnerability  
- Exploratory data analysis of environmental risk spread  

### **Stakeholder & Strategy Components**
- SWOT Analysis  
- Stakeholder Power–Interest Grid  
- Business Model Canvas (Strategyzer format)  
- Ethnographic observations via Google Street View
